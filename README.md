# vesselOS

> **Simple when you want it, powerful when you need it.**

vesselOS is a new, clean, and powerful self-hosted dashboard for managing Docker containers — designed for both beginners and advanced users who care about performance, control, and freedom.

Currently in early development.  
We’re building something fast, beautiful, and completely yours — no bloat, no tracking, no corporate nonsense.

Stay tuned for updates!
